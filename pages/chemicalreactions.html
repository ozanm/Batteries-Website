												<p><strong>A battery consists of one or more electrochemical cells. Each cell contains two metal electrodes and at least one electrolyte solution (a solution containing ions that can conduct electricity). The operations within the battery consists of electrochemical reactions called oxidation and reduction. These reactions involve the exchange of electrons between chemical elements. If an element loses one or more electrons, this is called oxidation. The opposite process, the gain of electrons, is called reduction. This is called aqueous electrolysis.</strong></p>

												<p><strong>If reactive components of an electrochemical cell are placed in contact with each other, they will perform a direct transfer of electrons. Since there is no way to harness this energy for electrical work, it gets released as heat. The heat released can then be calculated into the standard enthalpy change (delta-H°) of the reaction.</strong></p>

												<p><strong>In most batteries, there are different materials at the two electrodes, such that they want to react with one material being oxidized and the other being reduced.  In the cell below, Zinc is used for the electrode on the left (the Anode) in contact with a solution of Zinc (II) ions, possibly a solution of Zinc Nitrate.  Copper is used for the electrode on the right (the Cathode) in contact with a solution containing Copper (II) ions, perhaps Cupric Nitrate.  By keeping the materials separated, the electrons being produced by the oxidation at the Anode could be used to do electrical work as they are transferred to the Cathode where they will be consumed by the reduction process.  The amount of electrical work that a battery may produce is closely related to the standard free energy change (delta-G°) of the reaction.</strong></p>

											<p><strong>However, the oxidation process either produces positive ions or removes negative ions from the solution at the anode (or it may change one ion to a more positive one), and the reduction process either removes positive ions or produces negative ions in the solution at the cathode.  This produces electrically charged solutions, and very quickly stops the process before a measureable number of electrons are transferred.</strong></p>
											<p><strong>There must be a path for the ions to move between the two solutions in order for electrons to flow continuously through the wire.  This produces an "ion current" within the battery with cations (positively - charged ions) moving from anode to cathode, and anions (negatively - charged ions) moving from the cathode toward the anode.</strong></p>
