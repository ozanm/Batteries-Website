												<p><strong>Electricity, as you probably know, is the flow of electrons through a conductive path like a wire. This path is called a circuit.</strong></p>
												<p>Batteries have three parts, <u>an anode (-), a cathode (+), and the electrolyte (otherwise known as a Polymer Seperator)</u>. The cathode and anode (the positive and negative sides at either end of a traditional battery) are hooked up to an electrical circuit.</p>
												<p>Chemical reactions, which will be explained in the <a href="chemicalreactions">Chemical Reactions section</a>, causes a build up of electrons in the anode resulting in an electrical difference between thr anode and the cathode. Since the anode has more electrons than the cathode, it is unstable. Because of the electron's polarity, they try to rearrange themselves to undo this difference. The way they do this is because they repel each other and try to go to a place with fewer electrons.</p>

													<p><strong>Why do the electrons travel in a current through the wire if the area it needs to go is inside the battery?</strong></p>
													<p>In a battery, the only area with less electrons is the cathode. However, the electrolyte (or Polymer Seperator) keeps the electrons from going straight to the cathode within the battery.</p>
													<p>In the field of electrical engineering, the term "closed circuit" is used when descirbing a circuit that connects the cathode and the anode. When the circuit gets closed, the electrons can now travel to the cathode, hence balancing the positive and negative ends of the circuit.</p>
													<p>When these electrochemical processes occur, they change the chemicals in the anode and cathode seconds to make them stop supplying electrons. Rendering the amount of power available in the battery limited.</p>

											<p><strong>How do commercially available metal batteries developed by Duracell, Energizer, and other companys implement this system into their batteries for everyday electronics?</strong></p>
											<p><u>There are two types of these batteries: primary batteries and secondary or storage batteries. The diagrams on the right labels what each piece of both objects are and where the anodes, cathodes, and electrolytes are for both of them.</u></p>
											<p>Primary batteries are designed to be used unti the voltage is too low to operate a given device and are then discarded. An example of this would be the AA or AAA batteries that are used inside your TV remote and need to be replaced every couple of months. </p>
											<p>Secondary/Storage batteries have many specfial design features, as well as particular materials for the electrodes that permit them to be reconstituted (recharged). However, over a long amount of time and use they will need to be replaced because the recharged battery never gets back to its original state.</p>
